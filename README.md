## Scouting summary

A kinda-simple visual summary of robot's performance over a set of recorded matches. Output is designed to be printed.

To compile, just run `ant`.

Note: Scouting data (from Tech Valley Regional) is anything but accurate. Any robot pit scouting added is probably even less accurate, some of was even made up. The included python script is to convert that data into a more managable form.
